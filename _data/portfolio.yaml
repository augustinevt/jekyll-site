  name: August von Trapp

  about: I began traveling prolifically as a professional musician at a young age, working seriously in the context of a multitude of cultures and collecting a comprehensive worldview. My love of structure, composition, and creativity led me to begin working with code in 2015. I attended Epicodus, a web development boot camp, to learn how to create software by collaborating with a diverse team of other developers. In the time afterward, my unique intelligence and work ethic has allowed me the opportunity to work alongside truly talented people and use the cutting edge of technology and development methods.
